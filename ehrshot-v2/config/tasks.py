"""
Central task registry for all 15 clinical prediction tasks.

Each task maps to a natural-language query used in prompts.
All tasks use Yes/No output format.

Naming conventions:
  - guo_*   : Operational outcome tasks (ICU, length-of-stay, readmission)
  - lab_*   : Lab result abnormality tasks
  - new_*   : New diagnosis tasks (will the patient develop X in the next year?)
  - chexpert: Chest X-ray findings (binary abnormal / normal)
